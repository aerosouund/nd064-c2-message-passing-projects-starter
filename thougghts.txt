my questions

how to preserve front end functionality ? -no distruption to connections or persons being rest-
where is a location consumed ?
does having a locations service make things better ?
should there be a gateway service ?


my thoughts

the locations service is an rpc end point between itself and connections

location client and server for rpc + rest endpoint?
location service as rpc server with removal of rest logic ?

db writes for persons/locations as kafka queue

receives location as rpc and persons as rest
there is a rest endpoint for writes, persists requests to a kafka queue and then a worker writes to db
services keep existing func, on post they persist to kafka queue
locations implements rpc as reads


steps:
deploy a kafka container
write a consumer that wil poll the queue and write to the database
configure persons and locations to commit to this queue for writes
configure locations as an rpc server and connections as a client
