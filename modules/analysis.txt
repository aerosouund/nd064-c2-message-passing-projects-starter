-when you call locations route it calls the locationservice which retrieves location from db
-connections requires person id as a dependency

a location is a subclass of a connection, however it doesn't request data from it



connection services explanation:
- receives a person id
- searches for everyone that has been near this person in a given date range


requirements: 
- we need a persons service
- we need a connections service that will talk with this service
- we need a locations service but still trying to figure out how to isolate its logic


-techniques suggestion:
connections and persons have rest endpoints
connections + locations = ?
persons + locations = ?
connections still gotta have a rest endpoint though
the locations data need to be isolated in a service

what gets specific data ?
